      <h1> About me </h1>
      <p> Hello, my name is Tatsuya Rood’E, but everyone calls me Tats for short. A little about me, I am half Japanese and half Australian. I have completed high school up until grade twelve and received a cert three in hospitality. My main language is English but currently learning Japanese to connect with family and help grasp a deeper understanding of Japanese culture. From a young age I have always had a passion to create or improve. The first time I was exposed to Lego I was amazed, as it allowed me to create anything my imagination so desired. My hobbies include anything outdoors as well as computer games. Even though playing video games is fun I believe its important to balance my gaming time with outdoor activities. This mindset is an important skill I have been working on as it helps balance my work life from my social life. </p>

      <h1> Intrest in IT </h1>
      <p>The main interest in IT for me is the ability to create and improve. I was previously doing mechanical engineering and one of the general courses was digital fundamentals. I have never done coding before and when I did this subject, I found it to be interesting. Like Lego I find IT self-rewarding as you have the ability to create or improve. Because of this it sparked my curiosity into the IT world which led me to download Python. Within my own time Python allowed me to experiment and create little projects to better understand how the digital world works. An example of some of the projects I created was, a simple jumping game, password generator and a functioning clock. With many headaches and difficulties, I improved my knowledge of basic code and intern build upon my skills to be persistent and to learn from my past mistakes.</p>
      <p>Before I started Bachelor of Information Technology, I did a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering for a year through RMIT. As mentioned above I was introduced to digital fundamentals which sparked a new interest in career. Because of this I was already familiar with RMIT and its LMS system (Canvas). Therefore, going through RMIT would allow me an easier transition into a new course without having to learn a new LMS system. Furthermore, RMIT specializes in Information Technology thus, is a suitable candidate to study IT. </p>
      <p>Without IT we would not be where we are today. Whether we like IT or not it is clear now that IT is currently changing and shaping our future. It would be virtually impossible to stop the rapid acceleration of technology at its current rate. For this reason, I feel it is important for me to understand how the world is changing and to educate myself how IT operates in the real world. By the end of my studies, I hope to achieve a clear understanding of how IT functions and what I can do to positively contribute to society.</p>

      <p> Technology One or TechOne for short is a software development company creating and providing solutions to business and customers all around the world. TechOne is seeking an employee who is willing solve complex problems and is passionate about solving new challenges. TechOne’s main goal is to make life easy and simple for all its clients. I believe that TechOne is my ideal job as it is the first step to reaching my goal, as the company aims to help and improve peoples lives as well as supporting business. Furthermore, TechOne encourages their employees to be creative and imaginative which gives me the creative freedom to contribute my own ideas into the company. TechOne emphases on working as a team and helping individual employees build upon their skills to help further improve the company and the clients needs. </p>

      <p> The current job description for TechOne on seek.com is a graduate software developer with experience in .Net framework, .Net Core and C#. The company is needing someone who is willing to learn and expand upon their current skills to develop a clear understanding of the products features, functions, and design to be able to deliver a clean and efficient software. In addition, the employee will personally use and perform tests to guarantee the software is functioning correctly. However, to reach this goal TechOne needs someone who is motivated, passionate and has developed team working skills.</p>

      <p> While I lack the experience and degree needed for the job, I do have the right social skills and mindset for the job. Teamwork is an essential skill not just for software developers but for all industries. As a current employee in the chef industry, I know that working as a team is essential to work efficiently and effectively. It is important to clearly communicate with my colleagues to ensure no miscommunication or mistakes occur. Communication is also key to a healthy work environment and ensures harmony between all the employees to avoid someone feeling disvalued. This same skill also applies for a software developer. If the work environment is toxic or unwelcoming employees will feel disvalued or upset which ultimately effects work efficiency and work quality. Having a good mindset is also a key skill not just for software development but for life in general. Challengers are always going to occur in our daily lives, and it is important to have the right mindset to overcome and succeed any challenge that is presented before us. When faced with a challenge I set it as a goal rather than a tedious task. It is important for me to recognize that it is going to be difficult but to not let it overwhelm me. I always break down my goal into smaller manageable components. With this mindset I can stay motivated and passionate about my work allowing me to further improve my skills and overcome any challengers I may face. </p>

      <p> Of course, social skills and work ethic are important for TechOne but, it’s also just as important to have physical knowledge and experience in the IT industry. The main requirements to be eligible to apply is to graduate with a minimum of a bachelor, in a software related field and have experience with .Net framework, .Net Core and C#. At first it is overwhelming as I have no experience nor a degree but that does not stop me from getting the required skills, knowledge, and experience. To achieve these objects the first step would be to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology to be able to grasp the basic knowledge of how IT systems operate and function. From here I will be able to divert my time on more specific skills such as C#. With the basic knowledge I would have obtained during my IT degree I should be able to understand the fundamentals of code and software allowing me to easily build upon my current skills I would have obtained. As for experience getting an internship during my studies will greatly help getting some hands-on experience in the IT industry. Furthermore, exploring and creating basic IT systems in my own time will drastically help improve my skills making me more independent. </p>
