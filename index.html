      <h1> About me </h1>
      <p> Hello, my name is Tatsuya Rood’E, but everyone calls me Tats for short. A little about me, I am half Japanese and half Australian. I have completed high school up until grade twelve and received a cert three in hospitality. My main language is English but currently learning Japanese to connect with family and help grasp a deeper understanding of Japanese culture. From a young age I have always had a passion to create or improve. The first time I was exposed to Lego I was amazed, as it allowed me to create anything my imagination so desired. My hobbies include anything outdoors as well as computer games. Even though playing video games is fun I believe its important to balance my gaming time with outdoor activities. This mindset is an important skill I have been working on as it helps balance my work life from my social life. </p>

      <h1> Intrest in IT </h1>
      <p>The main interest in IT for me is the ability to create and improve. I was previously doing mechanical engineering and one of the general courses was digital fundamentals. I have never done coding before and when I did this subject, I found it to be interesting. Like Lego I find IT self-rewarding as you have the ability to create or improve. Because of this it sparked my curiosity into the IT world which led me to download Python. Within my own time Python allowed me to experiment and create little projects to better understand how the digital world works. An example of some of the projects I created was, a simple jumping game, password generator and a functioning clock. With many headaches and difficulties, I improved my knowledge of basic code and intern build upon my skills to be persistent and to learn from my past mistakes.</p>
      <p>Before I started Bachelor of Information Technology, I did a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering for a year through RMIT. As mentioned above I was introduced to digital fundamentals which sparked a new interest in career. Because of this I was already familiar with RMIT and its LMS system (Canvas). Therefore, going through RMIT would allow me an easier transition into a new course without having to learn a new LMS system. Furthermore, RMIT specializes in Information Technology thus, is a suitable candidate to study IT. </p>
      <p>Without IT we would not be where we are today. Whether we like IT or not it is clear now that IT is currently changing and shaping our future. It would be virtually impossible to stop the rapid acceleration of technology at its current rate. For this reason, I feel it is important for me to understand how the world is changing and to educate myself how IT operates in the real world. By the end of my studies, I hope to achieve a clear understanding of how IT functions and what I can do to positively contribute to society.</p>

      <p> Technology One or TechOne for short is a software development company creating and providing solutions to business and customers all around the world. TechOne is seeking an employee who is willing solve complex problems and is passionate about solving new challenges. TechOne’s main goal is to make life easy and simple for all its clients. I believe that TechOne is my ideal job as it is the first step to reaching my goal, as the company aims to help and improve peoples lives as well as supporting business. Furthermore, TechOne encourages their employees to be creative and imaginative which gives me the creative freedom to contribute my own ideas into the company. TechOne emphases on working as a team and helping individual employees build upon their skills to help further improve the company and the clients needs. </p>

      <p> The current job description for TechOne on seek.com is a graduate software developer with experience in .Net framework, .Net Core and C#. The company is needing someone who is willing to learn and expand upon their current skills to develop a clear understanding of the products features, functions, and design to be able to deliver a clean and efficient software. In addition, the employee will personally use and perform tests to guarantee the software is functioning correctly. However, to reach this goal TechOne needs someone who is motivated, passionate and has developed team working skills.</p>

      <p> While I lack the experience and degree needed for the job, I do have the right social skills and mindset for the job. Teamwork is an essential skill not just for software developers but for all industries. As a current employee in the chef industry, I know that working as a team is essential to work efficiently and effectively. It is important to clearly communicate with my colleagues to ensure no miscommunication or mistakes occur. Communication is also key to a healthy work environment and ensures harmony between all the employees to avoid someone feeling disvalued. This same skill also applies for a software developer. If the work environment is toxic or unwelcoming employees will feel disvalued or upset which ultimately effects work efficiency and work quality. Having a good mindset is also a key skill not just for software development but for life in general. Challengers are always going to occur in our daily lives, and it is important to have the right mindset to overcome and succeed any challenge that is presented before us. When faced with a challenge I set it as a goal rather than a tedious task. It is important for me to recognize that it is going to be difficult but to not let it overwhelm me. I always break down my goal into smaller manageable components. With this mindset I can stay motivated and passionate about my work allowing me to further improve my skills and overcome any challengers I may face. </p>

      <p> Of course, social skills and work ethic are important for TechOne but, it’s also just as important to have physical knowledge and experience in the IT industry. The main requirements to be eligible to apply is to graduate with a minimum of a bachelor, in a software related field and have experience with .Net framework, .Net Core and C#. At first it is overwhelming as I have no experience nor a degree but that does not stop me from getting the required skills, knowledge, and experience. To achieve these objects the first step would be to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology to be able to grasp the basic knowledge of how IT systems operate and function. From here I will be able to divert my time on more specific skills such as C#. With the basic knowledge I would have obtained during my IT degree I should be able to understand the fundamentals of code and software allowing me to easily build upon my current skills I would have obtained. As for experience getting an internship during my studies will greatly help getting some hands-on experience in the IT industry. Furthermore, exploring and creating basic IT systems in my own time will drastically help improve my skills making me more independent. </p>

      <p> The following three tests were taken: Myers Brigs test(<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank"> MyersBriggs </a>), learning style test (<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/" target="_blank"> learning test </a>), and Big Five personality test (<a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" target="_blank"> Truity </a>). The results of each test can be seen below.

        <br>
        <p> After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.  The results from the learning style test shows that I am predominantly a visual learner. Upon self-reflection this can be stated as true as I find that visually seeing a solution or problem helps me remember easier and understand the topic at hand. Reviewing the results from the Big Five Personality test I can agree that all five personality traits align with mine. In summary the results of all three tests provide a good general idea of what my personality type is and my learning style. However, everyone is different making it almost impossible to fully provide a description of everyone’s personality. The three tests helped me confirm and provide insight on my strengths and weaknesses which is important to know when working with a team. </p>

        <p> Its essential to know what my strengths and weaknesses are as it helps me understand my limitations on what I can and can’t do. By recognizing my weaknesses and strengths I will be aware of what I can contribute to the team and what parts I may struggle with. Knowing this it will directly influence my behavior towards my team as I would understand my limitations of what I can contribute to the team. Furthermore, as I am aware of my learning style, I can co-operate with my team members to help explain in a visual manner, intern helping me understand the topic easier. </p>

        <p> Teamwork is about a group of people working together in an efficient and effective manner to reach the same goal. Its important to understand each members individual strengths and weaknesses in order to allocate the appropriate task.  The results I have obtained will help me convey my strengths and weaknesses to my team, helping not only myself but the team as well. This will help devise a plan/strategy to complete the assigned work effectively and efficiently. </p>

      <h1> Project Idea </h1>
      <p1> Overview </p1>
      <p> This project idea is about a theoretical design called the Courtesy light. The Courtesy light is a small, simple, and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when activated by a simple press of a button mounted somewhere convenient in the driver’s seat compartment. Throughout the following report the project will discuss in detail about the individual aspects of the design, features, and software. In addition, the report will evaluate the feasibility and required skills to allow for this project to be a reality. Furthermore, the report will outline the impacts that the Courtesy light will create if it were to be introduced to the public. </p>

      <br>
      <p1> Motivation </p1>
      <p>Whether we like it or not almost every vehicle owner has at least once been the subject of road rage however, occasionally someone will show some courtesy on the road. Weather that be letting someone in or giving way or you may have left something on top of the car. Regardless of the situation we all get a sense of appreciation and think to ourselves I wish I could at least say ‘’Thanks/Sorry” to brighten up the fellow commuter’s day. In our current modern-day society, the use of cars has drastically expanded our capacity to travel. This is evident as according to <a href="https://www.pd.com.au/blogs/how-many-cars-in-the-world/" target="_blank"> pd.com.au </a>, there are currently 1.446 billion cars on the road as of 2022.  Therefore, this provides a vast extensive market for the use of a small, simple, and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when activated by a simple press of a button mounted somewhere convenient in the driver’s seat compartment. </p>

      <br>
      <p1> Description </p1>
      <p> The product LED “Thanks/Sorry” display can be called Courtesy light for short. The Courtesy light’s main two features is a LED display that will either display Sorry or Thanks. This will be activated using two simple buttons, one button will display Sorry and the other Thanks. The fundamental design of the Courtesy light is to keep it as simple as possible as it is important to not to overwhelm the driver with many features and buttons as this would lead to a safety hazard as it may be more of a distraction than a tool.

      Even though there are 1.446 billion cars, not all of these cars will be the same as there are numerous different cars manufactures with their own unique design. It is important that the Courtesy light has a universal installation method to allow the use of the LED light to operate in any vehicle. If the Courtesy light were only compatible with one specific car model this would drastically reduce the consumer market. A cheap and simple solution for this is for the use of Velcro. The buttons will be mounted with use of Velcro for easy and simple setup with the intention of user friendliness. The use of Velcro will allow the user to choose where the buttons will be setup for convince. Furthermore, as each car is different the use of the Velcro will allow universal compatibility with any car thus, anyone can use the product. Like the buttons the LED display will also use Velcro for the installation.

      The colour of the LED will be green. The colour green has been chosen as green generally represents a positive colour which will help further convey the message to the other drivers. In addition, green was chosen as it will not interfere with the existing lights on the vehicle. If the display were to be orange or red, it may be mistaken for a turn signal or break lights which would intern lead to a safety hazard to other drivers.  When the display is activated, the display will be a static light. If the display were to have flashing lights or cool animations, it would present more of a distraction rather than a message. For this reason, once the button is pressed the message will only display for a short period of time to allow the other driver to recognize the message without impeding on the drivers focus. To further ensure safety the LED’s will be set to a minimum legible brightness to prevent excessive light pollution.

      However, one major drawback of the Courtesy light is that the language displayed is English. While English is one of the dominate languages in the world there are still many opportunities to expand the product such as the east. A solution to this would be to add a feature that would incorporate other languages into the display. </p>

      <br>
      <p1> Tools and Technologies  </p1>
      <p>The aim of the Courtesy light was to keep the design as simple as possible, for this will allow for easy and cheap manufacturing. The hardware needed for the RGB light is either a raspberry pi or an Arduino Uno board. Either one of these will be sufficient to create a simple circuit to assemble the Courtesy light. In addition, the light will also require a generic breadboard, LED matrix, resistors, and jumper wires. The software required can be any software language. An example of such software’s can be python, atom.io or C+ just to name a few. With all these comments a basic version of the Courtesy light can be created. </p>

      <br>
      <p1> Skills Required   </p1>
      <p> The hardware skills required for the required project would be to at least have basic knowledge of electrical circuits. The project will be using a raspberry pi or an Arduino Uno which requires basic knowledge of hardware to understand how these hardware’s operate and function.  To obtain these skills you can either research and learn from an open source such as the internet or to take the relevant course through an education institute. The software aspect would be to have general knowledge in any programing language. The project requires code to be able to program what lights display and to program the buttons to activate for only a short period of time. These skills can be obtained through research from an open source or to study through an education institute such as a university. </p>

      <br>
      <p1> Outcome </p1>
      <p> If this project were successful many cars around the world would have installed the Courtesy light into their cars. Furthermore, if the project were successful many drivers around the would have theoretically diffused many road rage situations. An example might be that driver one has accidently cut off someone making the other driver two frustrated and on edge. However, if the driver one displays the “Sorry” LED, driver two will regionalize that it was an accident. By just showing a little courtesy on the roads everyday around the world it would lead to a much healthier environment on the public roads thus leading to less road rage and unnecessary toxicity. In Conclusion if the Courtesy light was introduced into the market, it would impact the number of road rage incidents occurring on public roads. </p>
