  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p> Hello, my name is Tatsuya Roodâ€™E, but everyone calls me Tats for short. A little about me, I am half Japanese and half Australian. I have completed high school up until grade twelve and received a cert three in hospitality. My main language is English but currently learning Japanese to connect with family and help grasp a deeper understanding of Japanese culture. From a young age I have always had a passion to create or improve. The first time I was exposed to Lego I was amazed, as it allowed me to create anything my imagination so desired. My hobbies include anything outdoors as well as computer games. Even though playing video games is fun I believe its important to balance my gaming time with outdoor activities. This mindset is an important skill I have been working on as it helps balance my work life from my social life.</p>
