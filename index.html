      <h1> About me </h1>
      <p> Hello, my name is Tatsuya Roodâ€™E, but everyone calls me Tats for short. A little about me, I am half Japanese and half Australian. I have completed high school up until grade twelve and received a cert three in hospitality. My main language is English but currently learning Japanese to connect with family and help grasp a deeper understanding of Japanese culture. From a young age I have always had a passion to create or improve. The first time I was exposed to Lego I was amazed, as it allowed me to create anything my imagination so desired. My hobbies include anything outdoors as well as computer games. Even though playing video games is fun I believe its important to balance my gaming time with outdoor activities. This mindset is an important skill I have been working on as it helps balance my work life from my social life. </p>

      <h1> Intrest in IT </h1>
      <p>The main interest in IT for me is the ability to create and improve. I was previously doing mechanical engineering and one of the general courses was digital fundamentals. I have never done coding before and when I did this subject, I found it to be interesting. Like Lego I find IT self-rewarding as you have the ability to create or improve. Because of this it sparked my curiosity into the IT world which led me to download Python. Within my own time Python allowed me to experiment and create little projects to better understand how the digital world works. An example of some of the projects I created was, a simple jumping game, password generator and a functioning clock. With many headaches and difficulties, I improved my knowledge of basic code and intern build upon my skills to be persistent and to learn from my past mistakes.</p>
      <p>Before I started Bachelor of Information Technology, I did a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering for a year through RMIT. As mentioned above I was introduced to digital fundamentals which sparked a new interest in career. Because of this I was already familiar with RMIT and its LMS system (Canvas). Therefore, going through RMIT would allow me an easier transition into a new course without having to learn a new LMS system. Furthermore, RMIT specializes in Information Technology thus, is a suitable candidate to study IT. </p>
      <p>Without IT we would not be where we are today. Whether we like IT or not it is clear now that IT is currently changing and shaping our future. It would be virtually impossible to stop the rapid acceleration of technology at its current rate. For this reason, I feel it is important for me to understand how the world is changing and to educate myself how IT operates in the real world. By the end of my studies, I hope to achieve a clear understanding of how IT functions and what I can do to positively contribute to society.</p>
